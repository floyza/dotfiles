#+title: dotfiles

My [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] dotfiles.

To use, just clone and run =sudo nixos-rebuild --flake '.#<system>' switch=, with =<system>= replaced with the desired system.

Or, =sudo nixos-rebuild --flake 'github:floyza/dotfiles#<system>' switch= if you don't want to clone it. How cool.

The structure of my dotfiles basically maintains the =configuration.nix=, =home.nix= and =hardware-configuration.nix= setup, only with added support for multiple systems.
Common settings are stored in ./common, and each system is stored in ./systems, defined by the three =configuration.nix=, =home.nix= and =hardware-configuration.nix= files.

Modules in ./modules are essentially just blocks of =configuration.nix= and =home.nix= split into separate files. They are not full nixos modules with an =enable= option to actually enable them. Because of this, to use/not use them you simply need to import/not import them into the system configuration.
